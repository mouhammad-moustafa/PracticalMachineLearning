The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which participants did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. You may use any of the other variables to predict with. 
You should create a report describing:  
- How you built your model,  
- how you used cross validation,  
- what you think the expected out of sample error is,  
- why you made the choices you did.  
- You will also use your prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.  

Lets start by reading training data. The training data file is stored in Data folder.

```{r}
training <- read.csv("./data/pml-training.csv")
str(training)
```
